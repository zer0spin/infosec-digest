        "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This class by Bill Roberts (a core maintainer in the tpm2-software organization), provides a comprehensive introduction to Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 programming using the Python-based tpm2-pytss library. Designed for developers, security engineers, and researchers, the course covers both foundational TPM 2.0 concepts and practical hands-on development techniques for interacting with TPM hardware and simulators.</p> <p>Students will learn the architecture and security goals of TPM 2.0, the structure of TPM objects, and how to work with cryptographic keys, non-volatile storage, platform configuration registers (PCRs), and authorization policies. Through the use of the tpm2-pytss library, participants will develop Python applications that interface with the TPM to perform tasks such as key provisioning, sealing and unsealing secrets, attestation, and policy-based access control.</p> <p>Like all current #OST2 classes, the core content is made fully public, and you only need to register if you want to post to the discussion board or track your class progress.

I almost never use Reddit to talk about professional matters, but I think this might be useful to some of you.</p> <p>I'm going to be addressing what seems to be a very common question - namely, what is more important when seeking employment - a university degree, certifications, or work experience?</p> <p>First, I'll give a very brief background as to who I am, and why I feel qualified to answer this question. I'm currently the Cyber Security Lead for a big tech firm, and have previously held roles as both the Enterprise Security Architect and Head of Cloud Security for a Fortune 400 company - I'm happy to verify this with mods or whatever might be necessary. I got my start working with cyber operations for the US military, and have experience with technical responsibilities such as penetration testing, AppSec, cloud security, etc., as well as personnel management and leadership training. I hold an associate's degree in information technology, as well as numerous certs, from Sec + and CISSP to more focused, technical security training through the US military and organizations like SANS.

I have my dual associates in Cybersecurity and network administration and am currently working on my Bachelor's at SANS.</p> <p>My first question has to do with the course options at SANS. I am getting to the part of the degree program where I can choose 3 electives. Right now I am leaning towards the GMON, GMLE, and GCFA courses. For those who work in the cyber defense side of things are there any other GIAC courses you might recommend instead? Im not exactly sure what is in demand other than GSEC and GCIH. I do already have the GFACT, GISF, GSEC, GCIH ,GPYC and GCIA included in my curriculum. For additional context I have my CCNA and Sec+ as well. </p> <p>My next question has to do with my current employment. As I stated I currently work in network administration but I was wondering if there may be another role that might align more with what a entry level soc analyst would need. Maybe working in a NOC? Are there any other positon you would recommend I look into while I work on my degree? Unfortunately with the current market and postings I've seen it seems like I might need the Bachelor's to get a interview. </p> <p>Lastly for anyone who has done the SANS Bachelor's, how was the internship? I've looked here and there but im not exactly sure what my duties would be and how much of a difference it will make on my resume since its only a few months and I have heard it described as a very light soc position.</p> <p>I do participate in CTF events every now and then and have dabbled with hack the box and tryhackme as well.</p> <p>Sorry for long wall of text but any advice or thought would be appreciated.

Everywhere I look is just telling me to do CTFs, set up a lab etc. However, I have no experience, no studies nor certifications at the moment and because of that, I have no idea what certifications to begin with since Security+ requires basics and network+ does too from what I’m getting. The only thing that could be considered is the fact that I’ve spent years playing and sometimes fixing basic things on computers and their softwares (from 7 years old to now 21). I’ve also read that its recommended to start in IT support jobs, which I’ve been looking at and applying, but they require (for some reason) a bachelors degree sometimes and multiple years of experience. My goal is to one day become a Pentester/ethical hacker, but I’m genuinely lost. I’m in Canada, Québec. Let me know any skills I might have that could be relevant or where/how to get started im very lost.

Just tired of seeing companies pay enterprise prices for grep and curl:</p> <p>I built a simple scanner that checks the technical parts of SOC2 (the ~30% that's actually infrastructure). It's not a complete compliance solution - won't write your policies or track vendor assessments. But it will tell you which S3 buckets are public, which IAM users lack MFA, and which access keys haven't been rotated in 90+ days.</p> <p><a href=\"http://github.com/guardian-nexus/auditkit\">github.com/guardian-nexus/auditkit</a></p> <p>It's rough but functional. Currently checks:</p> <ul> <li>S3 public access and encryption</li> <li>IAM MFA, password policies, key rotation</li> <li>Security groups (0.0.0.0/0 on SSH/RDP)</li> <li>CloudTrail logging</li> <li>Basic RDS encryption</li> </ul> <p>Fair warning: This only covers technical controls. You still need the policies, procedures, and evidence collection for a real audit. But at least you won't pay someone $500/hour to tell you to enable MFA on root. That said, AWS only right now, Azure/GCP on the roadmap if people actually use this. PR's welcome if you want to add Azure/GCP.</p> <p>EDIT#1: And yes, Prowler exists and is excellent for comprehensive security scanning. AuditKit is specifically focused on SOC2 technical controls with clearer remediation paths. If you need full security scanning, use Prowler. If you just need to pass SOC2 quickly, this might be simpler.</p> <p>EDIT#2: Thank you all for the great feedback. Looks like I'll be adding some new features, either tonight or tomorrow, based on the comments. For those asking &quot;why not use X?&quot; - you're right, there are better technical tools. This is for non-technical founders who just need to know if they'll pass and what evidence to collect.</p> <p>EDIT#3 - FINAL EDIT: **Frid",

And it’s not just us, our whole Technology department is tiny. Like, IT support only has 2 people covering all branches across the country and even branches in the Middle East and Asia. The “database team” is literally just 1 guy. Network team has 4, but to be fair they’re all really experienced and knowledgeable.</p> <p>What really surprised me was that as an intern I ended up handling a lot of the important tasks like all the SOC tickets from our vendor, EDR alerts, etc. And the vendor (L1) basically works like a postman, just passing everything to us without checking. By my 5th month, the company decided to switch to another SIEM with AI built-in which meant 3–4 months of super high false alerts while it collected data. (Imagine getting an alert every time a legit software runs. That was chaos, and I was handling it alone :)</p> <p>And thats not all, for EDR alert. There was one critical workbench flagged an open-source software as malware and isolated the endpoint. (Little flex but I’ve won multiple CTF and my specialty is DFIR and reversing.) On my day off I would analyzed the behavior just for my own learning, wrote up a report, and shared it with the team. Since then, any open-source software our devs need has to go through me first lol. Sometimes I even ask myself if I’m doing more than what I was supposed to. I’ve got more interesting cases I’ve handled in just 7 months but too lazy to write them all. Oh forgot to mention, I’ve also gotten offer from them to continue as a junior cybersecurity analyst but I afraid my job scope would be different than what written black and white</p> <p>Anyway, I always thought MNCs would have big cybersecurity teams, but now I’m not so sure. Do they usually run with such small teams and hire vendor?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

The problem comes to when I try to code, I often find myself copying other codes or just writing a large chunk of code that could have easily been shortened down given enough time and effort. I feel that I am behind where I should be in my class and I’m starting to stress out about my future in cybersecurity if I can’t get this coding stuff down. My questions to this community are. How should I go about pursuing a future in cybersecurity knowing these struggles? Anyone who was in my position what did you do? What cybersecurity jobs are there that don’t require coding?
