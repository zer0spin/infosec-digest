While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction at the intersection of AI safety and systems security...</p></blockquote>",

The fact that there are some weird circumstances that result in Fiat-Shamir insecurities isn&#8217;t new&#8212;many dozens of papers have been published about it since 1986. What this new result does is extend this known problem to slightly less weird (but still highly contrived) situations. But it&#8217;s a completely different matter to extend these sorts of attacks to &#8220;natural&#8221; situations...</p>",

Through the use of the tpm2-pytss library, participants will develop Python applications that interface with the TPM to perform tasks such as key provisioning, sealing and unsealing secrets, attestation, and policy-based access control.</p> <p>Like all current #OST2 classes, the core content is made fully public, and you only need to register if you want to post to the discussion board or track your class progress.

However, providing notifications has proven a challenge across industry.</p>\n<p>When making notifications, companies often do not know the true identity of victims and may only have a single email address through which to provide the notification. Victims often do not trust these notifications, as cyber criminals often use the pretext of an account compromise as a phishing lure.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>This report explores the challenges associated with developing the native-notification concept and lays out a roadmap for overcoming them.

The current study therefore uses visibleÂ­near-infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral imaging and deep learning (DL) methodologies. We acquired and preprocessed VIS-NIR (400Â­1000 nm) hyperspectral reflectance images of 93 dried squid samples. Important wavelengths were selected using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, principal component analysis, and the successive projections algorithm. Based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), we introduce a one-dimensional, KAN convolutional neural network (1D-KAN-CNN) for nondestructive measurements of fat, protein, and total volatile basic nitrogen&#8230;...</p></blockquote>",

She happened into technology after moving to the US, as she was the only person in her office under 40.

That launched her into a career that spanned supporting small nonprofits, working at one of the biggest banks on Wall Street while leading a global team, being the CISO of a major university, and now Advisory CISO at Cisco.

By chaining small gaps across tools like Gmail, Google Drive, and calendars, attackers achieved zero-click exfiltration, system mapping, and even policy rewrites. The findings highlight that excessive agent autonomy creates a new attack surface, requiring least-privilege design, runtime guardrails, and continuous red-teaming to stay secure.\n\nThe research can be found here:\n\n\n  The Silent Exfiltration: ZeroâClick Agentic AI Hack That Can Leak Your Google Drive with One Email\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Starting out as a Baptist minister with aspirations of being a professional musician, Julian found it more practical to take some technology classes and practice his saxophone when he had time. His first tech job was at Texaco where he worked on early networks and moved into systems engineering at Compaq. Julian notes his ADD made coding less attractive than talking with others to solve problems and Compaq provided him with opportunities to pivot. Searching out diversity, Julian moved to DC, and had his first taste of startups. He now describes himself as a serial entrepreneur.

Commissioned as a cryptologic warfare officer, Brandon was sent to MIT for a graduate degree where he experienced the exact opposite of the Naval Academyâs highly structured life. Brandonâs later work with both NSA and US Cyber Command helped him gain experience and cyber operations skills. As he transitions from active duty to civilian life, Brandon shares his personal challenges and struggles during that process.

With a background in psychology and counseling and not feeling that one-on-one counseling was her thing, Margaret had a transformational moment in her PhD program in applied experimental technology when she realized she could \"provide helping services and good work services at a broader scale.\" Margaret found her professional footing at DHS's Human Systems Integration Branch of Science and Technology Department as the person who figured out how to measure how new technologies impacted human performance.Â Margaret points out that making connections and reading whatever you can is important to stay up to date in the field. She notes that her statistical analysis skills are an asset. She hopes to create champions in human behavior and performance in the world of technology.

        "summary": "VP of Global Solutions Architecture at eSentire Tia Hopkins shares her career journey and talks about its beginnings in engineering and pivots into cybersecurity leadership. Tia shares how she liked to take things apart when she was young, including the brand new computer her mother bought her and how she was fascinated by all the pieces of it spread all across her bedroom floor.Â As she started studying engineering, Tia learned she was more of a technologist than an engineer. Tia got her start in technology without completing her formal education by what she says is \"grit and right place, right time.\" Once she was in a management role, Tia wanted to validate her knowledge, experience, and ability and not only completed her bachelor's degree, but also two master's degrees. Tia recently started an organization to encourage and grow interest, confidence, and leaders of women of color in the field of cybersecurity. We thank Tia for sharing her story with us.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

Spending time tinkering with things in the university's computer room under the stairs gave way to Kevin's love affair with technology. As Chief Security Officer, Kevin says he uses an analogy: \"I think we focus on the arrows, not the the archer\" meaning there's too much focus on the attacks rather than the ones mounting them.

The incident underscores the risks posed by third-party appliances and the importance of enhanced monitoring and threat detection to counter advanced persistent threats.\n The research can be found here:\nChina-Nexus Threat Group âVelvet Antâ Leverages a Zero-Day to Deploy Malware on Cisco Nexus Switches\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Itâs so popular many people just think Google is the Internet. Google hires many of the most talented minds and has been online since the 90s. Hacking into Google is no easy task. Thereâs a team of security engineers who test and check all the configurations on the site before they go live. And Google has teams of security analysts and technicians watching the network 24/7 for attacks, intrusions, and suspicious activity. Security plays a very vital role at Google, and everything has to have the best protections. But this attack slipped past all that. Hackers had found their way into the network. They compromised numerous systems, burrowed their way into Googleâs servers, and were trying to get to data they shouldnât be allowed to have. Google detected this activity. And realized pretty quickly they were dealing with an attack more sophisticated than anything theyâve ever seen.</p><p>Podcast recommendation: <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\"><strong>Twenty Thousand Hertz</strong></a></p><p><br /></p>",
