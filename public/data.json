Google is proud to announce that protected KVM (pKVM), the hypervisor that powers the Android Virtualization Framework, has officially achieved <a href=\"https://trustcb.com/download/?wpdmdl=5353\">SESIP Level 5 certification</a>. This makes pKVM the first software security system designed for large-scale deployment in consumer electronics to meet this assurance bar. <br /><h3><strong>Supporting Next-Gen Android Features</strong></h3>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe implications for the future of secure mobile technology are profound. With this level of security assurance, Android is now positioned to securely support the next generation of high-criticality isolated workloads. This includes vital features, such as on-device AI workloads that can operate on ultra-personalized data, with the highest assurances of privacy and integrity.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis certification required a hands-on evaluation by <a href=\"https://www.dekra.com/en/product-testing-and-certification-programs/\">Dekra</a>, a globally recognized cybersecurity certification lab, which conducted an evaluation against the <a href=\"https://trustcb.com/iot/sesip/\">TrustCB SESIP scheme</a>, compliant to <a href=\"https://www.nen.nl/en/nen-en-17927-2023-en-317686\">EN-17927</a>. Achieving Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platforms (SESIP) Level 5 is a landmark because it incorporates AVA_VAN.5, the highest level of vulnerability analysis and penetration testing under the ISO 15408 (Common Criteria) standard. A system certified to this level has been evaluated to be resistant to highly skilled, knowledgeable, well-motivated, and well-funded attackers who may have insider knowledge and access.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis certification is the cornerstone of the next-generation of Android’s multi-layered security strategy.

Advanced Protection gives you the ability to activate Google’s strongest security for mobile devices, providing greater peace of mind that you’re better protected against the most sophisticated threats.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdvanced Protection acts as a single control point for at-risk users on Android that enables important security settings across applications, including many of your favorite Google apps, including Chrome. In this post, we’d like to do a deep dive into the Chrome features that are integrated with Advanced Protection, and how enterprises and users outside of Advanced Protection can leverage them.\n</p>\n<p>\nAndroid Advanced Protection integrates with Chrome on Android in three main ways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Enables the “Always Use Secure Connections” </strong>setting for both public and private sites, so that users are protected from attackers reading confidential data or injecting malicious content into insecure plaintext HTTP connections. Insecure HTTP represents less than 1% of page loads for Chrome on Android. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Enables full Site Isolation </strong>on mobile devices<strong> </strong>with 4GB+ RAM, so that potentially malicious sites are never loaded in the same process as legitimate websites. Desktop Chrome clients already have full Site Isolation.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Reduces attack surface </strong>by disabling Javascript optimizations, so that Chrome has a smaller attack surface and is harder to exploit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nL",

When developers&#8212;­even experienced and security-conscious developers&#8212;­write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it&#8217;s easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities.

In that edition, twelve investors were observed to be domiciled within the United States&#8212;­whereas in this second edition, twenty new US-based investors were observed investing in the spyware industry in 2024.

I'm not a cybersecurity professional, but with the research I've been doing, I've written an overview of how I think we can secure a vibe-coded app without having to review every single line of code.</p> <p>In short, I think we should enable 3 main measures:</p> <ol> <li>Enable authentication on the infra layer (eg. on NGINX) so every request that reaches the app is already authenticated. This way, no one who doesn't have access to the app can even trigger any of its code.</li> <li>Visually show how the backend looks - what all API endpoints are, which role has access to which endpoint (RBAC), and what database and 3rd party API requests are made from the backend.</li> <li>Do a static and dynamic code scans with libraries like OWASP ZAP.</li> </ol> <p>More details in the post: <a href=\"https://blog.pythagora.ai/how-to-secure-ai-coded-vibe-coded-applications/\">https://blog.pythagora.ai/how-to-secure-ai-coded-vibe-coded-applications/</a></p> <p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this.</p> <p>What do you think is most important when securing a vibe coded app?

Most days it’s telling people where they can and can’t go, doing rounds and watching surveillance cameras. With the occasional fire alarm or disgruntled person.

After doing this, our next step is variant analysis: finding and investigating any variants of the vulnerability. It’s important that we find all such variants and patch them simultaneously, otherwise we bear the risk of these being exploited in the wild. In this post, I’d like to explain the automation we use in variant finding.</p>\n<p>For the past year or so, we’ve been augmenting our manual code review processes with <a href=\"https://www.semmle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Semmle</a>, a third-party static analysis environment. It compiles code to a relational database (the <em>snapshot database</em> – a combination of database and source code), which is queried using <a href=\"https://github.com/Semmle/ql#semmle-ql\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Semmle QL</a>, a declarative, object-oriented query language designed for program analysis.</p>\n<p>The basic workflow is that, after root cause analysis, we write queries to find code patterns that are semantically similar to the original vulnerability. Any results are triaged as usual and provided to our engineering teams for a fix to be developed. Also, the queries are placed in a central repository to be re-run periodically by MSRC and other security teams. This way, we can scale our variant finding over time and across multiple codebases.</p>\n<p>In addition to variant analysis, we’ve been using QL proactively, in our security reviews of source code. This will be the topic of a future blog post. For now, let’s look at some real-world examples inspired by MSRC cases.</p>",

It is a hardware vulnerability in DRAM where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows, leading to data corruption. This can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to data, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service. Hardware vendors have deployed various mitigations, such as </span><a href=\"https://www.jedec.org/category/keywords/ecc\"><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;\">ECC</span></a><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"> and Target Row Refresh (TRR) for DDR5 memory, to mitigate Rowhammer and enhance DRAM reliability.

While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction at the intersection of AI safety and systems security...</p></blockquote>",

        "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last week I posted a video on YouTube (inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/1nen55t/comment/ndt57hp/?context=1\">thread</a> in italian opened here on Reddit) in which I talked about the principle of least privilege, and about the fact that despite being a concept known for more than <a href=\"https://multicians.org/saltzer-pacisim.pdf\">50 years</a>, vendors struggle to apply it correctly. Violations are countless and this translates into trivial vulnerabilities that immediately grant remote access as root. This is a major problem especially in edge devices (SSL VPNs, firewalls, network gateways, etc.), now the main entry point for threat actors into corporate networks. It seems that none of the devices I analyzed (and for work I analyze many) is doing privilege separation correctly.</p> <p>In the aforementioned reddit thread, a user was asking for advice on what aspects to evaluate when purchasing a web application firewall. I suggested starting from the simplest thing: check whether the least privilege principle is respected or not as a first point to determine the robustness of a solution.</p> <p>Shortly after, however, I decided to show a practical case of violation. Suddenly I remembered a trick I had discovered about 5–6 years ago on Cisco ESA (Email Security Appliance now rebranded to Secure Email Gateway) to perform privilege escalation from nobody (or another unprivileged user) to root. I told myself there was no way that this trick (never reported to the vendor, though) could have survived the years without being found and fixed. So I downloaded the latest version of the product VM (branch 16.x), installed it...and guess what? The issue is still there.</p> <p>I made another video about it (my first in English language) if somebody is curious about.</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/99us9zVe9qc\">https://youtu.be/99us9zVe9qc</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

        "summary": "<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Jasika Bawa, Andy Lim, and Xinghui Lu, Google Chrome Security</span>\n\n<p>\nTech support scams are an increasingly prevalent form of cybercrime, characterized by deceptive tactics aimed at extorting money or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. In a tech support scam, the goal of the scammer is to trick you into believing your computer has a serious problem, such as a virus or malware infection, and then convince you to pay for unnecessary services, software, or grant them remote access to your device. Tech support scams on the web often employ alarming pop-up warnings mimicking legitimate security alerts. We've also observed them to use full-screen takeovers and disable keyboard and mouse input to create a sense of crisis. \n</p>\n<p>\nChrome has always worked with Google Safe Browsing to help keep you safe online. Now, with this week's launch of Chrome 137, Chrome will offer an additional layer of protection using the on-device Gemini Nano large language model (LLM). This new feature will leverage the LLM to generate signals that will be used by Safe Browsing in order to deliver higher confidence verdicts about potentially dangerous sites like tech support scams.\n</p>\n<p>\nInitial research using LLMs has shown that they are relatively effective at understanding and classifying the varied, complex nature of websites. As such, we believe we can leverage LLMs to help detect scams at scale and adapt to new tactics more quickly. But why on-device? Leveraging LLMs on-device allows us to see threats <em>when</em> users see them. We’ve found that the average malicious site exists for less than 10 minutes, so on-device protection allows us to detect and block attacks that haven't been crawled before. The on-device approach also empowers us to see threats <em>the way</em> users see them. Sites can render themselves differently for different users, often for legitimate purposes (e.g. to account for device differences, offer personali",

In 2024, scammers used increasingly sophisticated tactics and generative AI-powered tools to steal more than $1 trillion from mobile consumers globally, <a href=\"https://www.gasa.org/post/global-state-of-scams-report-2024-1-trillion-stolen-in-12-months-gasa-feedzai\">according to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance</a>. And with the majority of scams now delivered through phone calls and text messages, we’ve been focused on making Android’s safeguards even more intelligent with powerful Google AI to help keep your financial information and data safe.\n</p>\n<p>\nToday, we’re launching two new industry-leading AI-powered scam detection features for calls and text messages, designed to protect users from increasingly complex and damaging scams. These features specifically target conversational scams, which can often appear initially harmless before evolving into harmful situations. <br /><br />To enhance our detection capabilities, we partnered with financial institutions around the world to better understand the latest advanced and most common scams their customers are facing. For example, users are experiencing more conversational text scams that begin innocently, but gradually manipulate victims into sharing sensitive data, handing over funds, or switching to other messaging apps. And more phone calling scammers are using spoofing techniques to",

Keeping this ecosystem safe for users and developers remains our top priority. However, like any flourishing ecosystem, it also attracts its share of bad actors. That’s why every year, we continue to invest in more ways to protect our community and fight bad actors, so users can trust the apps they download from Google Play and developers can build thriving businesses. \n</p>\n<p>\nLast year, those investments included AI-powered threat detection, stronger privacy policies, supercharged developer tools, new industry-wide alliances, and more. As a result, <strong>we prevented 2.36 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play and banned more than 158,000 bad developer accounts that attempted to publish harmful apps. </strong><br />\n</p>\n<p>\nBut that was just the start.

I am not an expert in AD and sys administration know only Basics and time was also running out. So I asked him how does rdp and ssh work and what are their differences.

By chaining small gaps across tools like Gmail, Google Drive, and calendars, attackers achieved zero-click exfiltration, system mapping, and even policy rewrites. The findings highlight that excessive agent autonomy creates a new attack surface, requiring least-privilege design, runtime guardrails, and continuous red-teaming to stay secure.\n\nThe research can be found here:\n\n\n  The Silent Exfiltration: Zero‑Click Agentic AI Hack That Can Leak Your Google Drive with One Email\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Tom shares how his team works with researchers worldwide, why responsible disclosure matters, and how programs like Zero Day Quest (ZDQ) are shaping the future of vulnerability research in cloud and AI security. He also announced the next iteration of ZTQ with $5 million up for grabs. \n\nNext, Sherrod is joined by Eric Baller (Senior Security Researcher) and Eric Olson (Principal Security Researcher) to unpack the fast-changing ransomware landscape. From dwell time collapsing from weeks to minutes, to the growing role of access brokers, they explore how attackers operate as organized ecosystems and how defenders can respond. \n\nFinally, Sherrod welcomes Travis Schack (Principal Security Researcher) alongside Eric Olson to examine the mechanics of social engineering. They discuss how attackers exploit urgency, trust, and human curiosity, why AI is supercharging phishing campaigns, and how defenders can fight back with both training and technology. \n\nIn this episode you’ll learn:     \n\n\n  How MSRC partners with researchers across 59 countries to protect customers \n\n  Why Zero Day Quest is accelerating vulnerability discovery in cloud and AI \n\n  How ransomware dwell times have shrunk from days to under an hour \n\n\nResources: \n\n\n  \nView Sherrod DeGrippo on LinkedIn \n\n   Zero Day Quest — Microsoft \n\n  \nMicrosoft Security Response Center Blog \n\n\nRelated Microsoft Podcasts:  \n\n\n  Afternoon Cyber Tea with Ann Johnson\n\n  The BlueHat Podcast\n\n  \nUncovering Hidden ",

Dave and his Cookie Monster puppet spent much of his childhood putting on shows for his parents friends. During one of those performances, he was discovered and got his start at the local PBS station. A radio, television and film major in college, Dave owned his own company and as the most tech-savvy member of the group, handled that side of things. Dave notes his cybersecurity challenges back then consisted of maybe a corrupt floppy disk. It wasn't until he joined the CyberWIre that cybersecurity became Dave's focus. A former boss showed him how to lead a team and treat everyone with kindness regardless of their role. We thank Dave for sharing his story with us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Dr. Andrew Hammond, shares how he came to share the history of espionage and intelligence as a career. Starting out in the Royal Air Force when 9/11 happened, Andrew found himself trying to understand what was going on in the world. Studying history and international relations gave him some perspective and led him on his career path which included an introduction to museum industry at the 9/11 Museum. After a stint in academia in the UK, Andrew found his way back to the US and eventually ended up at the International Spy Museum in Washington, DC. He said one of the \"greatest parts of the job being able to engage with the artifacts\" and share their stories. We thank Andrew for sharing his story with us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

The campaign, which began preparation in mid-2024 and became active by late 2024, appears to be an evolution of previous Ghostwriter operations, combining disinformation with cyberattacks to further political and military objectives.\n\nThe research can be found here:\nGhostwriter | New Campaign Targets Ukrainian Government and Belarusian Opposition\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Together, they explore the latest in social engineering scams, phishing schemes, and cybercriminal exploits making headlines. Their guest, Seamus Lennon, ThreatLocker’s VP of Operations for EMEA, shares insights on Zero Trust security and the evolving threat landscape. Maria's story this week follows the IRS warning about a fake “Self Employment Tax Credit” scam on social media, urging taxpayers to ignore misinformation and consult professionals. Dave's got the story of the Better Business Bureau’s annual Scam Tracker report, revealing that online shopping scams continue to top the list for the fifth year, with phishing and employment scams remaining major threats, while fraudsters increasingly use AI and deepfake technology to deceive victims. Our catch of the day comes from Diesel in West Virginia, and features a scammer who tried to panic their target with a classic “We’ve frozen your account” scam—only to get hilariously mixed up with actual embryo freezing.\nResources and links to stories: \n\nBetter Business Bureau reveals top local scams of 2024\n\nIRS warns taxpayers about misleading claims about non-existent “Self Employment Tax Credit;” promoters, social media peddling inaccurate eligibility suggestions\n\nBBB Scam Tracker\n\nGot a $1,400 rebate text from the IRS?

Interested in computers and not a fan of math, Maria opted for information systems management rather than computer science. She started her career as a government contractor. Once in the private sector, Maria moved into the Unix and Linux environments where she says \"something that would totally change everything.\" She gained an interest in security and took it upon herself to train up and move into that realm. Maria notes it was not without roadblocks, but that being flexible helped her address those challenges and make her career in security happen.

        "summary": "VP of Global Solutions Architecture at eSentire Tia Hopkins shares her career journey and talks about its beginnings in engineering and pivots into cybersecurity leadership. Tia shares how she liked to take things apart when she was young, including the brand new computer her mother bought her and how she was fascinated by all the pieces of it spread all across her bedroom floor. As she started studying engineering, Tia learned she was more of a technologist than an engineer. Tia got her start in technology without completing her formal education by what she says is \"grit and right place, right time.\" Once she was in a management role, Tia wanted to validate her knowledge, experience, and ability and not only completed her bachelor's degree, but also two master's degrees. Tia recently started an organization to encourage and grow interest, confidence, and leaders of women of color in the field of cybersecurity.

Spending time tinkering with things in the university's computer room under the stairs gave way to Kevin's love affair with technology.

It’s so popular many people just think Google is the Internet. Google hires many of the most talented minds and has been online since the 90s. Hacking into Google is no easy task. There’s a team of security engineers who test and check all the configurations on the site before they go live. And Google has teams of security analysts and technicians watching the network 24/7 for attacks, intrusions, and suspicious activity. Security plays a very vital role at Google, and everything has to have the best protections. But this attack slipped past all that. Hackers had found their way into the network. They compromised numerous systems, burrowed their way into Google’s servers, and were trying to get to data they shouldn’t be allowed to have. Google detected this activity. And realized pretty quickly they were dealing with an attack more sophisticated than anything they’ve ever seen.</p><p>Podcast recommendation: <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\"><strong>Twenty Thousand Hertz</strong></a></p><p><br /></p>",

Também fala sobre as características do Brasil no que diz respeito aos tipos de malwares mais encontrados por aqui. Além das tendências dessa área, Assolini também destacou a evolução dos ataques envolvendo os PACs (proxy auto config). Em um desses casos, ele menciona que até mesmo órgãos governamentais e sistemas de segurança pública como o Consultas Integradas e o Infoseg (este último, sofrendo ataques desde 2007), já foram alvo dessa técnica de ataque.
