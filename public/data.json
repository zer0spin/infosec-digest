While prior work has examined prompt-based attacks (e.g., prompt injection) and data-oriented threats (e.g., data exfiltration), time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) remain largely unexplored in this context. TOCTOU arises when an agent validates external state (e.g., a file or API response) that is later modified before use, enabling practical attacks such as malicious configuration swaps or payload injection. In this work, we present the first study of TOCTOU vulnerabilities in LLM-enabled agents. We introduce TOCTOU-Bench, a benchmark with 66 realistic user tasks designed to evaluate this class of vulnerabilities. As countermeasures, we adapt detection and mitigation techniques from systems security to this setting and propose prompt rewriting, state integrity monitoring, and tool-fusing. Our study highlights challenges unique to agentic workflows, where we achieve up to 25% detection accuracy using automated detection methods, a 3% decrease in vulnerable plan generation, and a 95% reduction in the attack window. When combining all three approaches, we reduce the TOCTOU vulnerabilities from an executed trajectory from 12% to 8%. Our findings open a new research direction at the intersection of AI safety and systems security...</p></blockquote>",

The current study therefore uses visible­near-infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral imaging and deep learning (DL) methodologies. We acquired and preprocessed VIS-NIR (400­1000 nm) hyperspectral reflectance images of 93 dried squid samples. Important wavelengths were selected using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, principal component analysis, and the successive projections algorithm. Based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), we introduce a one-dimensional, KAN convolutional neural network (1D-KAN-CNN) for nondestructive measurements of fat, protein, and total volatile basic nitrogen&#8230;...</p></blockquote>",

She happened into technology after moving to the US, as she was the only person in her office under 40. Of course she would be comfortable with computers and able to handle a database conversion, right? That launched her into a career that spanned supporting small nonprofits, working at one of the biggest banks on Wall Street while leading a global team, being the CISO of a major university, and now Advisory CISO at Cisco. Helen recently wrote a book, \"Navigating the Cybersecurity Career Path,\" to help others know when it's time to move on from one role to another role as part of desire to give back to the community.

By chaining small gaps across tools like Gmail, Google Drive, and calendars, attackers achieved zero-click exfiltration, system mapping, and even policy rewrites. The findings highlight that excessive agent autonomy creates a new attack surface, requiring least-privilege design, runtime guardrails, and continuous red-teaming to stay secure.\n\nThe research can be found here:\n\n\n  The Silent Exfiltration: Zero‑Click Agentic AI Hack That Can Leak Your Google Drive with One Email\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "summary": "Please enjoy this encore of Career Notes. \n\nSenior Vice President and Executive in Residence with Rapid7 and Chairman for Cyversity, Julian Waits, grew up in the era of the Justice League and Superman and it shaped his career. Julian always wanted to do something where he could find a way to help society to basically help others. Starting out as a Baptist minister with aspirations of being a professional musician, Julian found it more practical to take some technology classes and practice his saxophone when he had time. His first tech job was at Texaco where he worked on early networks and moved into systems engineering at Compaq. Julian notes his ADD made coding less attractive than talking with others to solve problems and Compaq provided him with opportunities to pivot. Searching out diversity, Julian moved to DC, and had his first taste of startups. He now describes himself as a serial entrepreneur. We thank Julian for sharing his story with us.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",

But while it’s turbo-charging development, it’s also introducing new and largely unseen cyber threats.\n\nThe team at Pillar Security identified a novel attack vector, the ⁠\"Rules File Backdoor\"⁠, which allows attackers to manipulate these platforms into generating malicious code. It represents a new class of supply chain attacks that weaponizes AI itself, where the malicious code suggestions blend seamlessly with legitimate ones, bypassing human review and security tools. \n\nThe research can be found here:\n\n\n  ⁠New Vulnerability in GitHub Copilot and Cursor: How Hackers Can Weaponize Code Agents\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Commissioned as a cryptologic warfare officer, Brandon was sent to MIT for a graduate degree where he experienced the exact opposite of the Naval Academy’s highly structured life. Brandon’s later work with both NSA and US Cyber Command helped him gain experience and cyber operations skills. As he transitions from active duty to civilian life, Brandon shares his personal challenges and struggles during that process. Through the DoD Skillbridge Fellowship program, Brandon’s transition has him sharing his skills with the CyberWire.

Through hands-on comparisons and decompiled output analysis, the post highlights Rust’s growing appeal in offensive security while noting key OPSEC considerations and tooling limitations.\n\nThe research can be found here:\nRust for Malware Development\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "summary": "Please enjoy this encore episode with VP of Information Security at Barracuda Dave Farrow, and how he shares how a teenage surfer fell in love with software development and made his way in the cybersecurity field. Dave chose to study electrical engineering in college because he wanted to learn something that didn't make sense to him. He says he's done things in his career that he said he'd never do: for example, he went into and fell in love with software development. Taking on leadership of a bug bounty program at Barracuda blossomed into the creation of an internal security team. Dave wants to be the guy who enables the business and not the one who prevented it. He hopes all will come to recognize that there are other threats besides cybersecurity threats to business. We thank Dave for sharing his story with us.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Spending time tinkering with things in the university's computer room under the stairs gave way to Kevin's love affair with technology. As Chief Security Officer, Kevin says he uses an analogy: \"I think we focus on the arrows, not the the archer\" meaning there's too much focus on the attacks rather than the ones mounting them.

It’s so popular many people just think Google is the Internet. Google hires many of the most talented minds and has been online since the 90s. Hacking into Google is no easy task. There’s a team of security engineers who test and check all the configurations on the site before they go live. And Google has teams of security analysts and technicians watching the network 24/7 for attacks, intrusions, and suspicious activity. Security plays a very vital role at Google, and everything has to have the best protections. But this attack slipped past all that. Hackers had found their way into the network. They compromised numerous systems, burrowed their way into Google’s servers, and were trying to get to data they shouldn’t be allowed to have. Google detected this activity. And realized pretty quickly they were dealing with an attack more sophisticated than anything they’ve ever seen.</p><p>Podcast recommendation: <a href=\"https://www.20k.org/\"><strong>Twenty Thousand Hertz</strong></a></p><p><br /></p>",
